  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello, my name is John Ryan Villaluz. I am in my third-year studying Information Technology Management.</p>
  <p>Outside of school, I tend to usual play video games with friends, or write fictional stories just for fun. Halo is my favorite video game franchise.</p>
  <p>I am very invested into vexillology, which is the study of flags. I am also a huge military aviation enthusiast.</p>
